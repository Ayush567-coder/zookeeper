# zookeeper
The "zookeeper" is a program that focuses on the requirements of a zoo keeper, for whom it is difficult to look after his furry friends every now and then.
So through this programme we will help him to look into the habitat of animals and know about then situation there.
Comming to technical definitions and structuring of programme , the programme does not focus on finding out real scenerio.Here we have some preassumed story
for each habitat as the programme is not about interpretting info from cameras,but is to showcase the interpretted info from the cameras. 
So in a nutshell we have preassumed story for each habitat which we assume is provided to us by some other programme, 
What we will do
1) tell the zookeeper scenerio(fixed story) of the habitat he demands.
2) he can ask for any number of habitats one by one without restarting programme
3) and obviously a way to end the program, which is "exit" herein. And yeah exitting the programme is accompanied by a message of good bye too
